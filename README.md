# Weather Prediction and Pastoralist Recommendation System

## Overview

This project is the result of my participation in a hackathon where I leveraged Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict weather patterns, specifically focusing on distinguishing between 'rainy season' and 'dry season'. The project not only won the accolade for Biggest Climate Impact but also aims to provide actionable insights to pastoralists, helping them adapt their strategies based on the weather predictions.

## Objectives

- **Weather Prediction:** Utilize CNNs to accurately predict weather patterns based on traditional forecasting techniques which were used in differentiating onset of rainy seasons and dry seasons.
- **Pastoralist Recommendations:** Offer tailored recommendations to pastoralists to optimize their strategies for livestock management and resource allocation given the weather predictions.
- **Accessibility:** Make the system more accessible to pastoralists by integrating SMS notifications via Twilio.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow:** Utilized CNN's for weather prediction tasks due to their effectiveness in image recognition and pattern detection.
- **GPT-3.5:** Integrated for generating personalized recommendations based on the predicted weather patterns.
- **Twilio:** Employed for sending SMS notifications to pastoralists, ensuring accessibility to the recommendations.

## Implementation

The weather prediction model is built using CNNs trained on acacia trees which were valuable assets to traditional weather forecasters. It takes into account various parameters to distinguish between the rainy seasons and dry seasons with high accuracy.


Upon receiving the weather prediction results, the system generates personalized recommendations for pastoralists using the GPT-3.5 API. These recommendations include suggestions for livestock management, grazing areas, water resource allocation, and other strategies tailored to the predicted weather conditions.


To ensure accessibility, the system sends SMS notifications to pastoralists using Twilio's messaging service. This allows pastoralists to receive timely recommendations directly on their mobile phones, even in areas with limited internet connectivity.


This project pays homage to traditional methods rooted in indigenous knowledge. Acacia trees play a significant role in predicting weather patterns in many pastoralist communities in the Northern parts of Kenya. By observing the behavior of acacia trees, pastoralists can discern the onset of incoming seasons.

- **Flowering Acacia Trees:** In many regions, the flowering of acacia trees signals rainy seasons. The blossoming of flowers serves as a natural indicator of increased moisture and favorable conditions for rainfall.

- **Leaves Shedding Acacia Trees:** Conversely, the shedding of leaves by acacia trees indicates the transition into the dry season. As moisture levels decrease and drought conditions set in, the trees shed their leaves as a survival mechanism.


While traditional methods provide valuable insights, this project combines indigenous knowledge with modern technology to enhance weather prediction accuracy. The CNN model can be further trained on historical and modern weather data to complement these traditional methods, offering a more comprehensive, hybrid and reliable approach to forecasting weather patterns.


## Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced Prediction Models:** Continuously improve the weather prediction models by incorporating more data sources and advanced machine learning techniques.
- **Expanded Recommendations:** Expand the recommendation system to cover a wider range of pastoralist needs and scenarios.
- **Localization:** Customize recommendations based on the specific geographical and cultural context of pastoralist communities.
